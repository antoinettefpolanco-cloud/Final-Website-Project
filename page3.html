             <p>If Walls Could Talk:</p>
             <p>Its a double featuring one act show with one witten and directed by a student, 
                Raul Grijala-Gomez, and one written by our theater director, Sarah Sutton. The 
                Script Raul wrote is called "Copper Queen", its about the Copper Quen hotel in 
                Bisbee, Arizona. The scripts Ms. Sutton wrote is called "The Still of the Night", 
                its about mental disorders and having  to deal with them. To be able to get a part
                in this show you had to audition. The audition process is simple, for tech you had
                to have a mood board (unless for stage manager), and be prepared for questions, for 
                actors you had to performe a monolouge.</p>
                <p>After School Special:</p>
                <p>This is a variety shows. Variety shows we do more often than regular shows. 
                    Variety shows are where we have students write and direct their own scripts. 
                    When wirting the scripts you're also looking for people to play the roles in 
                    your script. There is no audition process for these type of shows. These shows 
                    are what bring us closer together becasue we're sometimes working with perople 
                    we don't really know. Working with them in this show brings you to get to know 
                    them.</p>
