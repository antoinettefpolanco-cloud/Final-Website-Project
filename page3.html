                hygien as a way to get a tiket. For non-donation shows tickets are usually $5 for 
                students and $8 in general for others.

            <p class="iwct"><b>If Walls Could Talk:</b></p>
            <p class="iwct">Its a double featuring one act show with one witten and directed by a
                student and our co-vice president, Raul Grijalva-Gomez, and one written by our 
                theater director, Sarah Sutton. To be able to get an acting/tech role in this show 
                you had to audition. The audition process is no longerthan 5 minutes and it's simple; 
                for tech you had to have a mood board, unless you were auditioning for stage manager,
                and be prepared for questions; for actors you had to performe a 3-5 minute monolouge. 
                The one act Raul wrote is called "Copper Queen", its based on the Copper Queen hotel 
                in Bisbee, Arizona. This one act ran for 45 minutes with trasnitions in between. 
                The one act Ms. Sutton wrote is called "The Still of the Night", it is about mental 
                disorders and having to deal with them. This one act ran for 15 minutes with no 
                transitions. This production was on stage for 6 days, that's the longest show we've 
                had all year. This was also our first ticket show of the year. The dates for this show
                were the 29th of October-7th of November with the 3rd & 4th of November being our days 
                to relax and the 31st of October being an in-school show because of Halloween.

            <p id="aftss"><b>After School Special:</b></p>
            <p id="aftss">This is a variety shows. Variety shows we do more often than other shows. 
                Variety shows are where we have students mostly write and direct their own scripts. 
                After wirting the scripts you have to start looking for people to play the roles 
                in your script. There is no audition process for these types of shows. These shows 
                are what bring us closer together becasue we're working together as a class. Working
                with them in this show brings you to get to know them. Our variety shows usually 
                have about 15-20 scenes each scene being 5-10 minutes. Betwen each scene is a 
                transition. Transitions can not be more than about 30 seconds unless absolutly needed. 
                This production was on stage for our usual 2 days. This was our first donation show 
                of the year. The dates for this show were the 18th & 19th of September.
