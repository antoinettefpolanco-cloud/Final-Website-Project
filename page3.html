            <p class="p">If Walls Could Talk:</p>
            <p class="p">Its a double featuring one act show with one witten and directed by a
                student and our co-vice president, Raul Grijalva-Gomez, and one written by our 
                theater director, Sarah Sutton. To be able to get a part in this show you had to 
                audition. The audition process is simple; for tech you had to have a mood board,
                unless you were auditioning for stage manager, and be prepared for questions; 
                for actors you had to performe a 3-5 minute monolouge. The audition process is no longer 
                than 5 minutes. The one act Raul wrote is called "Copper Queen", its based on the 
                Copper Queen hotel in Bisbee, Arizona. This one act ran for 45 minutes with trasnitions 
                in between. The one act Ms. Sutton wrote is called "The Still of the Night", it is about 
                mental disorders and having to deal with them. This one act ran for 15 minutes with no 
                transitions. This production was on stage for 6 days, thats the longest show we've had 
                all year. This was our first ticket show of the year.</p>

            <p id="p">After School Special:</p>
            <p id="p">This is a variety shows. Variety shows we do more often than other shows. 
                    Variety shows are where we have students write and direct their own scripts. 
                    When wirting the scripts you're also looking for people to play the roles in 
                    your script. There is no audition process for these types of shows. These shows 
                    are what bring us closer together becasue we're working with people we don't
                    really know. Working with them in this show brings you to get to know them.
                    Our variety shows usually have about 15-20 scripts each script being 5-10 
                    minutes. Betwen each script is a transition. Transitions can't be more than 
                    30 seconds unless absolutly needed. This production was n stage for our usual 
                    2 days. This was our first donation show of the year.</p>
